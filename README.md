### Hello! üëã üéâ

> Rookie mistake... got locked out of [my old github](https://github.com/jossmurphy) due to 2FA issues. 

Now that we're both here, welcome! 

### Currently, 
* On the job hunt! Looking for  Winter 2023 software development & product management internships at mission-driven companies. 

* Starting my 2B term of [Systems Design Engineering](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Systems-Design-Engineering) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

* Building community at [UW Startups](https://www.instagram.com/uwstartups/) & sourcing companies as a Venture Partner with [Contrary Capital](https://contrary.com/). 

### What motivates me:
üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë  I'm highly collaborative and love working with, learning from, and creating opportunities for others. I feel most at home when I'm surrounded with people who love to give back. 

üèÜ  Some of the work I'm most proud of includes leading [SVP Teens](https://www.svpteens.org/) and developing at [UW Blueprint](http://uwblueprint.org/), two organizations where students apply their skills (technical or otherwise) to make a tangible impact on charitites and non-profit organizations. 

ü§ì  Finally, nothing beats the thrill of learning something new, whether that be related to software, policy, design, or weird historical facts. Very succeptible to a good old fashioned [nerd snipe](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nerd-snipe).
