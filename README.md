### Hello! üëã üéâ

> Rookie mistake... got locked out of [my old github](https://github.com/jossmurphy) due to 2FA issues. 

Now that we're both here, welcome! 

We'll be great friends if you're  kind, ambitious, and nerdy (in that order).

### Currently, 
* On the job hunt! Looking for  Summer 2024 software development & product management internships at mission-driven companies.

* In my 3A Term of [Systems Design Engineering](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Systems-Design-Engineering). Lots of physics, lots of math. ü•µ Connecting it all together with [Systems Modelling](https://ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/2324/COURSE/course-SYDE.html#SYDE351), which is possibly the coolest course I've taken so far. 

* Building community at [UW Startups](https://www.instagram.com/uwstartups/) and holding space for people to work on their high-effort passion projects at [Socratica](socratica.info)!

* Just wrapped up my time as a Product Management Intern at [Culdesac](https://culdesac.com/), where I designed a system to collect, display, and review data in support of helping residents adapt successfully to car-free living. 

### What motivates me:
üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë  I'm highly collaborative and love working with, learning from, and creating opportunities for others. I feel most at home when I'm surrounded by people who love to give back. 

üèÜ  Some of the work I'm most proud of includes leading [SVP Teens](https://www.svpteens.org/) and doing design and software development at [UW Blueprint](http://uwblueprint.org/), two organizations where students apply their skills (technical or otherwise) to make a tangible impact on charitites and non-profit organizations. 

ü§ì  Finally, nothing beats the thrill of learning something new, whether that be related to software, policy, design, or weird historical facts. Very succeptible to a good old fashioned [nerd snipe](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nerd-snipe).
